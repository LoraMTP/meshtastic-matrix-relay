# M<>M Relay

## (Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay)

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

## Getting Started

M<>M Relay runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. For setup, configuration, and usage instructions, see the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports serial, network, and **_BLE (now too!)_** connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom fields are embedded in Matrix messages for relaying messages between multiple meshnets
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store node information for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1
- Relays messages to/from an MQTT broker, if configured in the Meshtastic firmware
- ✨️ _Cross-platform reactions support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**

_We would love to support [Matrix E2EE rooms](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/issues/33), but this is currently not implemented._
